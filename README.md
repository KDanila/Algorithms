#Algorithms
- [Link to course]

This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data 
structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers 
elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.

###Part-1: Union−Find
- [Union find]

We illustrate our basic approach to developing and analyzing algorithms by considering the dynamic connectivity problem. 
We introduce the union−find data type and consider several implementations (quick find, quick union, weighted quick union, 
and weighted quick union with path compression). Finally, we apply the union−find data type to the percolation problem 
from physical chemistry.
